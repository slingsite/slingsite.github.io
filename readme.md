# slingsite.github.io

This repository hosts the **deployed website** for [https://slingsite.github.io](https://slingsite.github.io), powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

---

## 📦 Repository structure

- **`gh-pages` branch** → contains the static site build (generated by Next.js with `output: export`).  
  This branch is served directly by GitHub Pages.  
- **`main` branch** → holds metadata files such as `README.md` and `LICENSE.md`.  
  It does not contain source code.

## ⚙️ Source code

The actual source code of the website lives in a separate repository:  

👉 [https://github.com/damiarita/slingsite](https://github.com/damiarita/slingsite)

That repository contains the full Next.js project along with the GitHub Actions workflow used to automatically build and deploy to this repo.
